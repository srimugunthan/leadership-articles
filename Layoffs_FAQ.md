While there's no single definitive time of the month for company layoffs, there are some trends and factors to consider:

**End of the month or quarter:** Companies often conduct layoffs towards the end of a month or quarter. This allows them to finalize financial reports and start the next period with a restructured workforce.
Beginning of the year: Many companies finalize budgets and strategic plans at the start of a new year. If layoffs are necessary for cost-cutting or restructuring, they may occur in January or February.

**Economic factors:** Layoffs are often influenced by the overall economic climate. During economic downturns or recessions, companies may be more likely to lay off employees to reduce costs.   
**Industry trends:** Some industries may have specific times of the year when layoffs are more common. For example, retail companies might have layoffs after the holiday season.   
It's important to remember that these are just general trends, and layoffs can happen at any time of the month or year.

Negotiation is possible: Don't hesitate to negotiate your severance package if you believe you deserve more.
Review the agreement carefully: Before accepting a severance package, review the agreement carefully to understand all the terms and conditions.
